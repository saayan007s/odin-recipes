    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Lasagna is a beloved Italian dish known for its rich layers of pasta, meat or vegetable filling, creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese, and a generous topping of melted cheese. Originating from Italy, particularly the region of Emilia-Romagna, lasagna has become a global comfort food, with countless variations tailored to different tastes and dietary preferences. Traditional lasagna al forno consists of wide, flat pasta sheets layered with a slow-cooked ragù made from ground beef or pork, tomato sauce, and aromatic herbs. Each layer is generously coated with béchamel sauce or ricotta cheese, adding creaminess that balances the robust flavors. Finally, a golden, bubbly crust forms on top as it bakes, often made from mozzarella, Parmesan, or a blend of cheeses.</p>

    <p>Beyond its classic form, lasagna can be adapted in many ways, making it a versatile dish. Vegetarian versions often substitute meat with sautéed spinach, mushrooms, zucchini, or even lentils for a hearty texture. Some modern recipes use different types of pasta, such as whole wheat or gluten-free alternatives, while others swap traditional ingredients for plant-based or dairy-free options. Even regional Italian variations exist, like the Neapolitan lasagna, which includes hard-boiled eggs and small meatballs. No matter the variation, lasagna remains a satisfying, crowd-pleasing dish that brings together layers of rich, comforting flavors. </p>
