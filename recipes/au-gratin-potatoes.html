    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Au gratin potatoes are a classic comfort food that combines thinly sliced potatoes and onions with a rich, creamy Cheddar cheese sauce, all baked until tender and golden brown. This dish is cherished for its harmonious blend of flavors and textures, making it a favorite accompaniment to various main courses.</p>

    <p>To prepare au gratin potatoes, start by layering half of the thinly sliced potatoes in a buttered casserole dish, seasoning them with salt and pepper. Add a layer of sliced onions, followed by the remaining potatoes, seasoning each layer as you go. In a saucepan, melt butter over medium heat, then whisk in flour and salt, cooking for about a minute. Gradually add milk, continuing to whisk until the mixture thickens. Stir in shredded Cheddar cheese until melted and smooth. Pour this cheese sauce over the layered potatoes and onions, cover the dish with aluminum foil, and bake in a preheated oven at 400°F (200°C) for approximately 1.5 hours, or until the potatoes are tender and the sauce is bubbly.</p>
    
    <p>This method yields a dish where the creamy cheese sauce perfectly complements the tender potatoes and onions, resulting in a satisfying side that's sure to please at any meal.</p>
