# odin-recipes

I am learning web development from [the odin project's foundation course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations).

This project is an assignment from the course. I am aiming to create a simple website (basic HTML, no CSS) about some recipes. I hope to use my knowledge of git and html to get this done. Wish me luck!
